The Solidus Community Conduct Guidelines

The Solidus project wishes to provide a respectful and collaborative environment for our contributors and stakeholders. This document outlines guidelines that will help our community foster a positive, safe, and productive space. These guidelines should be respected in all "collaborative spaces," such as mailing lists, chat applications, pull requests, commit comments, etc.

* Participants will be tolerant of opposing views and individuals.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behavior which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

We are not legal experts, law enforcement professionals, or trained mediators therefore the Solidus project will defer whenever possible to teams with the resources and training to handle any violations of our community guidelines or the platform guidelines of any tool being used by the project (e.g. GitHub or Slack).

If you feel that you're being harassed or that someone is directly violating the community guidelines, please reach out to the Core Team by sending an email to [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. We will do whatever we can to assist those experiencing harassment.
